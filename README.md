## How it works:
The script is  built with images that have broad use case as long they cater and center on women and female children causes. This script will not work without php, simply because all files are included via php. So enedeavour to run this script on a php-supported server or better still, port it to another platform or language , as all files are written in html but only inclluded using php..

Below is an example code of the index page to see how files are included.
````php
<!DOCTYPE html >
<html>
<head>
<?php include('store/head.html'); ?>
</head>
<body>
<div class="bg-shadow">
<div class="under">
<div class="site-block">
<?php include('store/header.html');?>
<div class="content-block">
<?php include('store/left.html');?>
<?php include('store/home.html');?>
</div>
<?php include('store/footer.html');?>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<?php include('store/foot.html');?>
</body>
</html>
````

Below is a break down of folders in the script and what contain:
1) Assets: Contains front-end dependencies
2) CSS: Contains styling dependencies
3) Fonts: contains font files dependencies
4) Image: contains site Images
5) js: contains javascript dependencies


Not all the dependencies are used, some were simply experimented with during development.

The major dependency files used in production are :
1) css/template.css
2) css/menu.css
3) js/siteHeader.js
4) js/jquery.js
5) js/homepage2.css

Other files apart from the above listed were not used on site. You can experiment with them if you so wish.<br/>

The major font file(verdanda.tttf) used was included via the css files. <br/>

These are the other files used:<br/>
Store: This folder contains all site pages that are included in the files in the main directory. This files are stored here to allow for flexible chnage of site details without having to going through thousands o lines of html codes

The other unmentioned files are self explanatory in their names and all codes are easily editable by opening them up in a code editor and removing and replacing html tags
